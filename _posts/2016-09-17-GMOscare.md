title: Food production
subtitle: Why are GMOs such a big scare?
---

<p1>Global food production and genetically engineered crops are a lasting favourite topic of mine. Or at least they score quite high on my list, like any matter where xenophobia usually gets the best of people. Last month <a href="http://supportprecisionagriculture.org/view-signatures_rjr.html" target="_blank">a big number of Nobel laureates</a> started <a href="http://supportprecisionagriculture.org/" target="_blank">a campaign</a> and <a href="http://supportprecisionagriculture.org/nobel-laureate-gmo-letter_rjr.html" target="_blank">published a letter</a> aimed for world leaders and Greenpeace activists. Here's a short <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/us/stop-bashing-gmo-foods-more-than-100-nobel-laureates-say.html?_r=0" target="_blank">NYtimes story</a> to bring you up to speed. The main point is that they feel genetic engineering as a technology of improving crop plant is being attacked without any valid reason. Now, the message seems clear, and bravo to the laureates for taking this stance. It's a clever way of bringing attention to an important matter. Make no mistake, the Nobel committee is very thorough in choosing their candidates, and the laureates really do represent some of the best people science has to offer. You, me, or any other normal human being has absolutely no chance of ever winning that prize, sorry (despite what the laureates themselves might say; several of them have seemed to be suprised and humbled by their nomination).  To me, over 100 of them saying anything really is almost a biblical truth. Well, not really, but it's a pretty good bunch to choose to trust I'd say. But then how did Greenpeace respond? Did they stop objecting GMOs or did they even consider what about 100 of the best scientists had to say? <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/2016/Nobel-laureates-sign-letter-on-Greenpeace-Golden-rice-position---reactive-statement/" target="_blank">Of cource they didn't.</a></p1>
<p1>Also, Rachel Feltman writes a short and sweet piece in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/09/02/why-gmo-free-is-a-marketing-ploy-you-shouldnt-fall-for/?tid=a_inl" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> about the trend of labeling groceries 'GMO-free'. In Finland, companies like <a href="https://www.snellman.fi/fi/blogi/heidi/gm-vapaa-sika-ja-nautaketju" target="_blank">Snellman</a> and <a href="http://www.valio.fi/yritys/artikkelit/valion-maito-syntyy-ilman-gmota/" target="_blank">Valio</a> have lately jumped in this bandwagon as well. The proponents' usual argument for this practice (after everything else fails) is that it provides customers freedom of choice of knowing what their food is made of. And I agree, I'd rather know what I'm putting in my mouth. But in this case, it's not as if the producers actually added any value to their products, nor did they remove anything harmful, and by labeling a product GMO-free they're not even arguing that they did. They're simply taking the position that there's something inherently wrong with genetic engineering. Everybody can make their own judgments, but one must ask, why would anyone attack a <i>technology</i> if not for profit only?</p1>
<p1>But I feel there's more to GMO-labeling than a marketing ploy. In July, biotech reseacher Lauri Reuter wrote <a href = "http://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2016/07/15/luomu-taytyy-korjata" target="_blank">a very accurate description</a> of what's wrong with the European 'organic' movement</p1>
<p1>Anyways, if you don't agree with Greenpeace, or at least agree with 100 Nobel laureates, you can sign their petition <a href="http://supportprecisionagriculture.org/join-us_rjr.html" target="_blank">here. I'll be posting a lot more on the topic later.</a></p1>
