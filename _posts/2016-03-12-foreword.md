Hi, I'm Antti, a very concerned citizen from Finland. Youâ€™ve reached my personal project pages. This site is just a random assortment of my thoughts, projects I've been working on and a repository of links to interesting stuff from the web. For more general info about these pages, read on.

For my bio, see the [about page](http://anttitenkanen.github.io/about/).

This site is ***under construction***, so tread carefully.
This site comprises mostly of short stories and things I find interesting. Most of the stuff here requires some background knowledge in the subject matter, and this site is not intended as especially lightweight. Anything that I find time to post here tends to be straight to the point and important somehow.

### Why?

When I began my PhD studies I felt a kind of obligation to take part in at least some of the discussion in society and wanted to start sharing the little I know about stuff. I might still fail to do that, but at least I hope this site will offer a little bit of interest to some people. Maybe spark some ideas or discussions. I will also try to share some project ideas. Mainly though, this site is just a diary for myself.
_Disclaimer_: All opinions are mine, and mine alone.
