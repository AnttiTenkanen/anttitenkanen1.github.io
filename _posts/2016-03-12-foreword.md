Hi, I'm Antti, a concerned citizen from Finland. You’ve reached my personal project pages, a repository of stuff where I expose that there's a flaw in the world. But if you really just came here just to see my bio/CV, head right on to the [about page](http://anttitenkanen.github.io/aboutme/).

 Also this site is a random assortment of my thoughts and links to things I find interesting. Many a thing here is written tongue in cheek, many more I take quite seriously
 
I’m currently at the University of Eastern Finland (UEF). My main research topic is boreal forest tree ecophysiology and photosynthesis modeling. So expect to see some of that. **But that’s not all there is to life!**

This site is ***under construction***, but will mainly be used as a repository for my thoughts on my other interests in life

- Photography
- Music
- Electronics
- Homebrewing (yes, beer)
- Statistics and the R language
- I will also be providing links to interesting discussions on
   - Global food production
   - Pseudoscience
   - etc...

### Why?

To be honest, I haven't been very active in social media, and when I began my PhD studies I felt a kind of obligation to take part in at least some of the discussion in society and wanted to start sharing the little I know about stuff. I might still fail to do that, but at least I hope this site will offer a little bit of interest to some people. Some of the discussion might be in Finnish only without any warning :)
