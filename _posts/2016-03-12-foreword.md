Hi, I'm Antti, a concerned citizen from Finland. Youâ€™ve reached my personal project pages. This site is a random assortment of my thoughts and links to things I find interesting. For my bio, see the [about page](http://anttitenkanen.github.io/aboutme/). For general info about these pages, click below

This site is ***under construction***, but later you will find stuff here related to:

- Photography
- Music
- Electronics
- Homebrewing (yes, beer)
- Statistics and the R language
- I will also be providing links to interesting discussions on
   - Global food production
   - Organic food production
   - GMOs
   - Science, pseudoscience and the philosophy of science
   - and some fun stuff also

### Why?

To be honest, I haven't been very active in social media, and when I began my PhD studies I felt a kind of obligation to take part in at least some of the discussion in society and wanted to start sharing the little I know about stuff. I might still fail to do that, but at least I hope this site will offer a little bit of interest to some people. Some of the discussion might be in Finnish only without any warning :)
