Need inspiration on more favorably rephrahing a non-significant result in your publication? Find <a href="https://mchankins.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/still-not-significant-2/" target="_blank">a complete list of excuses here</a>, or you can let <a href="http://www.sumsar.net/blog/2014/02/a-significantly-improved-test/" target="_blank">Rasmus Bååth's R-code </a> choose the right wording for you! Btw, this is just for fun (; but a good reminder about perhaps sticking to your chosen philosophy of science. Read more about it <a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~abe/lista/pdfVZSdqrML7E.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. There's also a nice, easy article <a href="http://www2.uni-jena.de/svw/metheval/lehre/0405-ws/evaluationuebung/haller.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (for non-statisticians) about how to teach NHST to non-statistician students and how to avoid the pitfalls of misinterpreting basic concepts.
