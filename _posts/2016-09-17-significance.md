Significant. It's one of those ambiguous words you often hear in connection with almost any science-related news story (well, apparently newsworthy science news anyways). Let's analyze this somewhat. Btw, I give absolutely no warranty whatsoever about whatsoever I say, I'm a completely non-statistician biology PhD-student...

So.

You may not be a scientist, or even the scientifically-inclined type, but reminisce the last time you read some interesting science story from basically any news media. Like maybe your most trusted state-run news organization. Maybe the news was about some habit being connected to a personality trait, maybe about some new promising drug, or maybe even Chances are that in the story there was at least one mention of the results being 'highly significant'. After all, why publish a story if this wasn't the case. But what exactly does it mean?

Let's break it down a bit. 



Well then, now that that's out of the way, do you need inspiration on more favorably rephrahing a non-significant result in your publication? Find <a href="https://mchankins.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/still-not-significant-2/" target="_blank">a complete list of excuses here</a>, or you can let <a href="http://www.sumsar.net/blog/2014/02/a-significantly-improved-test/" target="_blank">Rasmus Bååth's R-code </a> choose the right wording for you! Btw, this is just for fun (; but a good reminder about perhaps sticking to your chosen philosophy of science. Read more about it <a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~abe/lista/pdfVZSdqrML7E.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. There's also a nice, easy article <a href="http://www2.uni-jena.de/svw/metheval/lehre/0405-ws/evaluationuebung/haller.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (for non-statisticians) about how to teach NHST to non-statistician students and how to avoid the pitfalls of misinterpreting basic concepts.
