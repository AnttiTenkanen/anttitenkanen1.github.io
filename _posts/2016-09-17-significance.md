Significant. It's one of those ambiguous words you often hear in connection with almost any science-related news story (well, apparently newsworthy science news anyways). I'm not going to try to answer the question in the title straight away, but instead let's analyze this somewhat.

You may not be the scientifically-inclined type, but reminisce the last time you read some science story from basically any news media. Chances are there was at least one mention of the results being 'highly significant'. After all, why publish a story if this wasn't the case. But what exactly does that mean?

Let's break it down a bit. When you hear that phrase in a story about a new cancer drug, 

Well then, now that that's out of the way, do you need inspiration on more favorably rephrahing a non-significant result in your publication? Find <a href="https://mchankins.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/still-not-significant-2/" target="_blank">a complete list of excuses here</a>, or you can let <a href="http://www.sumsar.net/blog/2014/02/a-significantly-improved-test/" target="_blank">Rasmus Bååth's R-code </a> choose the right wording for you! Btw, this is just for fun (; but a good reminder about perhaps sticking to your chosen philosophy of science.

There's also a nice, easy article <a href="http://www2.uni-jena.de/svw/metheval/lehre/0405-ws/evaluationuebung/haller.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (for non-statisticians) about how to teach NHST to non-statistician students and how to avoid the pitfalls of misinterpreting basic concepts.
