Significant. It's one of those ambiguous words you often hear in connection with almost any science-related news story (well, apparently newsworthy science news anyways). It's also one of the more interesting subjects for me personally. So let's analyze it a bit. (That said, I give absolutely no warranty whatsoever about whatsoever I say. I'm a completely non-statistician biology PhD-student and I'm just exploring the subject... comments very welcome)

So.

You may not be a scientist, or even the scientifically-inclined type, but reminisce the last time you read some interesting science story from basically any news media. Maybe the news was about some habit being connected to a personality trait, or maybe about some new promising drug passing trials. Chances are that in the story there was at least one mention of the results being 'highly significant'. After all, why publish any story if this wasn't the case. Maybe the headline read something like "cats in trees significantly more likely to see firemen in their lifetime than cats who stayed on the lawn!". Now that's interesting, right!? But what exactly does it mean when we say something is significant?

Let's break it down a bit.

When you hear the word 'significant' in everyday life, it usually carries some oomph: "humans have had a significant effect on the climate of the Earth", "your mother is significantly overweight", "significant other". In other words, something is seen as important, substantial. But the word has lived a double life, the other meaning rather hidden from the public. You see, for scientists from practically every discipline of the sciences (verifiable sciences anyways, kind of, I'll get back to this in a later post) it has been the daily grind for a good part of a century now to divide the results of experimental and observational studies into 'significant' and 'not significant' (if you're interested in the why, google R.A. Fisher, but don't necessary blame the man for anything, he was just misunderstood...). And it seems reasonable; after all, we do want to have concrete, hands-on answers to important questions like 


Then so what? You might think that's all semantics and who cares anyways? Statisticians do, they really do.




Well then, now that that's out of the way, do you need inspiration on more favorably rephrahing a non-significant result in your publication?

Btw, this is just for fun (; but a good reminder about perhaps sticking to your chosen philosophy of science.

There's also a nice, easy article <a href="http://www2.uni-jena.de/svw/metheval/lehre/0405-ws/evaluationuebung/haller.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (for non-statisticians) about how to teach NHST to non-statistician students and how to avoid the pitfalls of misinterpreting basic concepts.
