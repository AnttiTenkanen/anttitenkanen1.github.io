**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:
 
| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
x <- 5 + 10
print(x)
~~~

And here is some code with syntax highlighting

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```
