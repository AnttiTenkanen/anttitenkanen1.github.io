These are my personal project pages, read here for more info.                                                 

Hi! You’ve reached the homepages of Antti Tenkanen, a random collection of my thoughts and links to things I find interesting. I’m a biology PhD student at the University of Eastern Finland (UEF), and my main research topic is boreal forest tree ecophysiology and photosynthesis modeling. So expect to see some of that. **But that’s not all there is to life!**

If you came here just to see my bio, head right on to the [about page](http://anttitenkanen.github.io/aboutme/).
