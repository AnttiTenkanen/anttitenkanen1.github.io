These are my personal project pages, read here for more info.
Hi! You’ve reached the homepages of Antti Tenkanen, a random collection of my thoughts and links to things I find interesting. I’m a biology PhD student at the University of Eastern Finland (UEF). If you came here just to see my bio, head right on to the [about page](http://anttitenkanen.github.io/aboutme/). My main research topic is boreal forest tree ecophysiology and photosynthesis modeling. So expect to see some of that. **But that’s not all there is to life!**

This site is ***under construction***, but will mainly be used as a repository for my thoughts on my other interests in life

- Photography
- Music
- Electronics
- Homebrewing (yes, beer)
- Statistics and the R language
- I will also be providing links to interesting discussions on
   - Global food production
   - Pseudoscience
   - etc...

### Why?

To be honest, I haven't been very active in social media, and when I began my PhD studies I felt a kind of obligation to take part in at least some of the discussion in society and wanted to start sharing the little I know about stuff. I might still fail to do that, but at least I hope this site will offer a little bit of interest to some people. Some of the discussion might be in Finnish only without any warning :)
