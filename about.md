I'm a first year PhD student at the University of Eastern Finland (UEF), my <i> alma mater </i>. My budding professional interests lie in plant physiology and biostatistics, but I also quite regularly follow (and sometimes take part in) the discussion centering around genetic engineering (of crop plants). During any spare time I either play computer games, take photographs, brew a beer, play the guitar, dabble in electronics, read, listen to music, start a new hobby or just hang.
